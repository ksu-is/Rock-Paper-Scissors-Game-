# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game-
Rock Paper Scissors is a game made for two players, in which the player has to make a shape with their hands that symbols a rock, paper, or scissors. 
We are creating a Rock, paper, and scissors app game, that can be used just for someone's entertainment or to make a decision between two people or more.
